# Road-network-path-redundancy-enhancement-under-uncertainty
The provided code snippets are associated with the research titled "Road network path redundancy enhancement under uncertainty." Within this study, we have developed three precise algorithms tailored to the proposed model.To aid readers in gaining a better understanding of both the proposed model and the three algorithms, we provide a small example intended to be solved manually. Please refer to the APPENDIX for details. As part of our practical applications, we offer the code implementations for the deterministic equivalent program, specifically designed to address the smaller case study. This manual solvability serves the purpose of facilitating readers in acquiring a deeper comprehension of the solution methodologies employed by the algorithm. In the provided HTML document, readers can DOWNLOAD these document and promptly observe the results. Furthermore, readers have the option to COPY the code snippets and EXECUTE them on their Python platforms for further exploration and experimentation.
